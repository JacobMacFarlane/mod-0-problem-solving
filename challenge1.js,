// for challenge 1 i am given the task of creating an array of strings
//  To do this i will set my var as things than after my equal signs
//  i will use square brackets and list off all of my strings
//  then i will create a for statement. In the for statment i will have a conditional 
// if statement in order to only put words down that have 4 characters
// this is ymbolized by `if (things[i].length === 4)`
// then after this i call my function using console.log(things[i])
// i put things[i] isnide of console.log in order to tell the computer i want the contents of the array
